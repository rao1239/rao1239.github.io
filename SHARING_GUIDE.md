# 🌐 How to Share Your Portfolio

To give your portfolio link to anyone, you need to host your `index.html` file online. Here are the three easiest ways to do it for free:

---

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
This gives you a link like `yourname.github.io`.

1. **Download your site**: Go to your local website, click **Edit Site**, enter your password, and click **Download Ready-to-Publish HTML**.
2. **Create a Repository**: Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository (e.g., named `portfolio`).
3. **Upload**: Upload your `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and your `assets/` folder to that repository.
4. **Enable Pages**: Go to **Settings > Pages**. Under "Branch", select `main` and click **Save**.
5. **Done!** Your site will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/portfolio/`.

### Option 2: Netlify (Fastest - No Code)
This gives you a link like `your-site-name.netlify.app`.

1. **Download your site**: Use the "Download Ready-to-Publish HTML" button in your Admin Panel.
2. **Visit Netlify Drop**: Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
3. **Drag and Drop**: Drag your entire `resume_website` folder onto that page.
4. **Done!** It will immediately give you a link to share.

### Option 3: Vercel
This gives you a link like `your-site.vercel.app`.

1. Similar to Netlify, go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your GitHub repository.
2. It will automatically build and provide a link.
